# Investigate_FBI_Gun_Data
This project focuses on investigating the FBI gun data in conjunction with the US census data using Python. The datasets used in this project are the US census data and the gun data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) criminal background check system.

## Dataset Overview

### US Census Data

The US census dataset provides population estimates for each state of the United States based on specific years. It contains various demographic and population-related facts for analysis.

### FBI Gun Data

The FBI gun data includes information on the number of guns, permit checks, long guns, handguns, and other variables for each state on specific dates. It is collected through the FBI's criminal background check system.

## Project Details

In this project, Python programming language is used for data analysis and visualization. The following steps were taken to investigate the FBI gun data:

1. Data collection: The US census data and the FBI gun data were obtained from reliable sources.

2. Data preprocessing: The datasets were cleaned, formatted, and transformed to ensure consistency and compatibility for analysis.

3. Data analysis: Various statistical analyses and exploratory data visualizations were performed to gain insights into the relationship between gun data and population.

4. Findings and conclusions: The project findings were summarized and conclusions were drawn based on the analysis of the datasets.

## Technologies Used

The project was implemented using Python programming language. The following libraries were utilized:

- Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib: Employed for data visualization and creating plots.
- NumPy: Used for numerical computations and array operations.

## Future Work

This project serves as a preliminary investigation into the relationship between gun data and population. Further analysis can be conducted to explore additional factors and trends that may influence the patterns observed in the data.

## Credits

- US Census Bureau: Provided the US census data.
- Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI): Provided the gun data from the criminal background check system.
